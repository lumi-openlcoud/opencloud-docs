# Gateway LAN communication protocol V2.0

## **Overview**

LUMI Smart Gateway supports LAN communication features. Through opening the LAN communication API, developers are allowed to manage each ZigBee sub-device (sensor, controller, etc.) under the gateway via LAN communication.

Compared to HTTP communication, LAN communication is faster and has lower control latency. However, the development cost of a LAN connection is higher. Furthermore, it requires a third-party gateway that supports development and the developer has experience in embedded development.

Currently, the main API features opened are:

- Discover and query devices
- Report device status
- Read and write operations on devices
- Report device heartbeat

## **Revision record**

## **Encryption mechanism**

The key encryption method is applied in LAN communication, and the APP needs to obtain a randomly generated gateway KEY. The gateway KEY is encrypted by AES-CBC 128 and is a string of 16 bytes in length. Can only use Gateway LAN Communication after activating the the LAN Communication protocol and obtaining the key for the gateway. 

> **Note:** That the initial vector of the AES-CBC 128 is defined as: unsigned char const AES_KEY_IV [16] = {0x17, 0x99, 0x6d, 0x09, 0x3d, 0x28, 0xdd, 0xb3, 0xba, 0x69, 0x5a, 0x2e, 0x6f, 0x58, 0x56, 0x2e}.



Specific operations for obtaining the gateway KEY are as follows:

1.Add Hubs on Aqara Home App, then login AIOT Opencloud Website and enter Console.

2.Select "Gateway LAN", enter Aqara account and password.

3.Seclect the Hub to enable "LAN Communication Protocol" to get a random KEY.



## **Discovery and Query Devices**

### **Discover the gateway device**

The device discovery operates in unencrypted mode and use **multicast** (**IP: 224.0.0.50  peer_port: 4321 protocal: UDP**) to discover the gateway device on the LAN.

Send the "whois" command in multicast mode:

```
{
   "cmd":"whois"
}
```

All gateways that receive the "whois" command are required to reply with their own IP information in **unicast** mode:

```
{
   "cmd":"iam",
   "ip":"192.168.0.42",   //Gateway IP address
   "protocal":"UDP",
   "port":"9898",
   "model":"gateway.aq1",  //Gateway device model
   ......
}
```

### **Query sub-device list**

The command is sent via **unicast** to the **UDP 9898** port of the gateway, which is used to obtain the sub-devices in the gateway.

Send a "discovery" command to the gateway via unicast:

```
{
   "cmd":"discovery"
}
```

The gateway replies by unicast, returning the device id and model value of the sub-devices:

```
{
   "cmd":"discovery_rsp",
   "sid":"xxxxxxxx",     //sid is gateway did
   "token":"TahkC7dalbIhXG22",    //random string generated by the gateway
   "dev_list":[{"sid":"158d0000f1a750","model":"plug"},  
               {"sid":"158d00010fd645","model":"sensor_switch.aq2"}]  //sid is sub-device did
}
```

> **Note**: "token" is a random string generated by the gateway. It is refreshed every 10s. Before the token is received from the device according to heartbeat of the device, the user can use this token to generate a "key" for writing to the device.

## **Report device status**

When the device status changes, the "report" command is sent via **multicast** to (**IP: 224.0.0.50 Port: 9898**) to report the status attribute such as the opening or closing information detected by the door and window sensors. Using the attribute status that are reported, the user can create related intelligent operations, such as turning on the air conditioner when the windows are closed.

Example:

Door and window sensors reported the open/close status of windows, the format is as follows:

```
{
   "cmd":"report",
   "model":"sensor_magnet.aq2",
   "sid":"xxxxxxxx",
   "params":[{"window_status":"open"}] 
}
```

## **Report device heartbeat**

**Gateway heartbeat**

The gateway heatbeat is sent via **multicast** to **(IP: 224.0.0.50 Port: 9898**). The gateway sends a heartbeat packet every 10 seconds to inform the PC gateway that it is working normally. If the heartbeat packet is not received after more than 65 seconds, the status of the gateway set to off-line. Heartbeat format of the gateway device is as follows:

```
{
    "cmd":"heartbeat",
    "model":"gateway.v3",
    "sid":"xxxxxxxx",
    "token":"1234567890abcdef",   //random string generated by the gateway
    "params":[{"ip":"172.22.4.130"}]  //Gateway IP address
 }
```

> **Note**: "token" is a random string generated by the gateway. It is refreshed every 10s. This token can be used to generate the "key" when writing to the device.

**Heartbeat of Sub-devices**

The heartbeat of sub-devices are sent via **multicast** to (**IP: 224.0.0.50 Port: 9898**). The sub-device tells the PC via the heartbeat that the sub-device is working normally (heartbeat reporting frequency: generally devices in sleep mode report once every hour, and devices that are plugged in to electrical outlets report once every 10 minutes). The heartbeat format of sub-devices is as follows:

```
{
   "cmd":"heartbeat",
   "model":"sensor_magnet.aq2",
   "sid":"xxxxxxxx",
   "params":[{"window_status":"open"}]
}
```

The heartbeat of the sub-device may contain the attribute status of the sub-device, such as  `"window_status": "open"`. When setting the heartbeat, consideration need to be given for the statuses of usage scenarios.

For example: Open window and close air conditioning scenario, you can use the above heartbeat to trigger actions. But in the close window and turn on air conditioning scenario, you can not use the above heartbeat. This is because it is possible that the air conditioner was turned off when the person leaves, but the heartbeat message turns on the air conditioner with nobody in the room, so it is a waste of electricity.

Therefore, when using heartbeat messages, the user can decide whether to use the heartbeat to trigger certain actions according to the user's usage needs.

## **Read and write operations of the device**

**Reading devices**

Send the "read" command via **unicast** to the gateway's UDP 9898 port. Users can take the initiative to read the attribute status of each device, and the gateway returns all the attribute information associated with the device.

Example:

Read the status of the wall switch:

```
{
   "cmd":"read",
   "sid":"xxxxxxxx"   //wall switch did
}
```

Gateway sends reply via **unicast**, the format is as follows:

```
{
   "cmd":"read_rsp",
   "model":"ctrl_neutral2",
   "sid":"xxxxxxxx",
   "params":[{"channel_0":"on"},{"channel_1":"off"}]  
}
```

**Writing devices**

Send the "write" command via **unicast** to the gateway's UDP 9898 port. When users need to control the device, the user can use the "write" command.

Example:

Change the status of the wall switch (With Neutral, Single Rocker) to off:

```
{
    "cmd":"write",
    "model":"ctrl_neutral1",
    "sid":"xxxxxxxx",
    "key":"3EB43E37C20AFF4C5872CC0D04D81314",
    "params":[{"channel_0":"off"}]
 }
```

Gateway sends reply via **unicast**, the format is as follows:

```
{
   "cmd":"write_rsp",
   "model":"ctrl_neutral1",
   "sid":"xxxxxxxx",
   "params":[{"channel_0":"on"}]  
}
```

This "write_rsp" only represents that the gateway has received the write command. The attribute status in params is the current status of the current device, not the final device status after the write operation. The final device status is reported by "report" message.

> **Note**: "key" is a 32-byte string. When the encryption mode is enabled on the gateway, the key is decrypted and validated to verify the validity of the write command. The "key" generation rule is as follows: After receiving the 16-byte "token" string in the heartbeat, the user uses the KEY of the gateway (random KEY obtained in the APP) to perform AES-CBC 128 encryption, generating 16 bytes of ciphertext. The ciphertext is then converted to a 32-bytes ASCII coded string.
>
> For example, the random KEY with a length of 16 characters in the Mi Smart Home APP is "0987654321qwerty", the token is "1234567890abcdef", and the encrypted ciphertext is 0x3E,0xB4,0x3E,0x37,0xC2,0x0A,0xFF,0x4C,0x58,0x72,0xCC,0x0D,0x04,0xD8,0x13,0x14. So the "key" is: "3EB43E37C20AFF4C5872CC0D04D81314".

## **Device reporting and control message format**

JSON message basic format:

```
{
   "cmd":"write",     //command type(write/read/write_rsp/read_rsp/report/heartbeat)
   "model":"ctrl_neutral2",   //device type
   "sid":"xxxxxxxx",    //device did
   "params":[{"channel_0":"on"},{"channel_1":"off"}]  
   //params can contain multiple properties for the same device
}
```

```

### **Temperature and Humidity Sensor**

(device model：weather)

When the temperature and humidity sensor detects temperature changes over 0.5 degrees or more than 6% humidity change, a report will be sent. The atmospheric pressure value will be sent along with the temperature or humidity report. The Temperature and humidity sensor also reports the current temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure values during each heartbeat.

| **Attributes**  | **Description**                          |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| temperature     | Temperature, numeric, default invalid value is set to 10000 |
| humidity        | Humidity, numeric, the default invalid value is set to 0 |
| pressure        | Atmospheric pressure value, numerical, unit Pa, value range 30000 ~ 110000 The default invalid value is 0 |
| battery_voltage | Button battery voltage, measured in mv units, range 0~3300mv. Under normal circumstances, less than 2800mv is considered to be low battery power. |
